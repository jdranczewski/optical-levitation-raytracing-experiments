# Configuration files
This folder contains a few example configuration files, which should help you get
a good grasp of the `conf.yaml` file structure.

**In particular,** have a look at `config_example.yaml`, which is well commented.

To use a particular config file, pass it as an argument when running `simulate.py`.
For example:

`python simulate.py configs/config_example.yaml`

**For a robust way of analysing this data, see `output-inspector.ipynb`.
